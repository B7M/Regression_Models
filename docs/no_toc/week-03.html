<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.1</span> Multi-variable regression</h2>
<p>We now extend linear regression so that our models can contain more variables. A natural first approach is to assume additive effects, basically extending our line to a plane, or generalized version of a plane as we add more variables. Multi-variable regression represents one of the most widely used and successful methods in statistics.</p>
<p>If you’re utilizing predictor X to forecast a response Y and discover a meaningful relationship, there is a potential issue if the predictor hasn’t been randomly assigned to the subjects or units being observed. In such cases, there is always a concern that there might be another variable, whether known or unknown, that could account for the observed relationship. For example, imagine if you had a friend who downloaded some data, where they had all sorts of health information from people
and also their dietary information. This person claims to have found an interesting relationship: breath mint usage has a significant regression relationship with forced expiratory volume(FEV), a measure of lung function. You would be skeptical there is very little basis for a biological relationship there. Breath mints are just sugar! But maybe, but what you’ve really be thinking is what other variables might explain this relationship? You might have two hypotheses: this person dug through lots and lots of variables and just found the one that was significant, and it’s just a chance of association, which is the problem of multiplicity. In addition it is likely, you would think the real problem is smokers tend to use more breath mints, and smoking has this relationship with lung function. It’s well-established that chronic exposure to a smoker, even second-hand smoke has negative impacts on lung function. So it’s probably smoking it probably has nothing to do with the breath mints, it’s a indirect effect of breath mints through smoking, not a direct effect of breath mints on lung function. This would be the hypothesis. To establish that there is a breath mint effect beyond smoking we could consider smokers by themselves, and see whether their lung function differs by their breath mint usage, and consider non-smokers by themselves, and see whether their lung function differs by breath mint usage, where we conditioned on smoking status. This way we would compare like with like. Multivariable regression is sort of automated way to do that in a linear fashion. It makes fair enough assumptions, in automated way. In this section we will explain how it works and we will also talk a little bit about its limitations.</p>
<p>Multivariable regression is trying to look at the relationship of a predictor and a response, while having, at some level, accounted for other variables. Moreover, multivariable regression is actually a good prediction model.
For example, a Kaggle competition wanted to predict the number of days a person would be in the hospital in subsequent years given their claims history and number of days they were in the hospital in previous years. The insurance companies seek to harness an extensive dataset derived from claims, aiming to predict a singular numerical outcome. However, the conventional approach of simple linear regression would be insufficient when confronted with multiple predictors. How can we extend the scope of simple linear regression to accommodate a multitude of regressors for predictive purposes? The procedure is similar to simple linear regression where there is more predictor terms, X values. For example, <span class="math inline">\(X_1\)</span> might be the number of insurance claims in the previous year, and <span class="math inline">\(X_2\)</span> might be whether or not the person had a particular cardiac problem, and so on. The first variable is typically just a constant one, so there is an intercept that’s included, a term that’s just <span class="math inline">\(\beta_0\)</span> by itself. Interestingly in this competition, we found that multivariable regression could get people very close to the winning entry, while other machine learning methods like random forest, and boosting only improved the results minorly on top of multivariable regression.</p>
<p>Note: in case of breath mint study, one of the predictors, <span class="math inline">\(X_1\)</span> might be breath mint usage (a binary variable), and <span class="math inline">\(X_2\)</span> might be how much a person smoked.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The general linear model extends simple linear regression (SLR) by adding terms linearly into the model.
<span class="math display">\[
Y_i =  \beta_0 X_{0i} + \beta_1 X_{1i} + \ldots +
\beta_{p} X_{pi} + \epsilon_{i} 
= \sum_{k=0}^p X_{ik} \beta_j + \epsilon_{i}
\]</span></p></li>
<li><p>Where <span class="math inline">\(X_{1i}=1\)</span> typically, the <span class="math inline">\(\beta_j\)</span> are the coefficients of the model.</p></li>
<li><p>Least squares (and hence ML estimates under iid Gaussianity of the errors) minimizes
<span class="math display">\[
\sum_{i=1}^n \left(Y_i - \sum_{k=1}^p X_{ki} \beta_j\right)^2
\]</span>
Note, the important linearity is linearity in the coefficients. Thus
<span class="math display">\[
Y_i =  \beta_1 X_{1i}^2 + \beta_2 X_{2i}^2 + \ldots +
\beta_{p} X_{pi}^2 + \epsilon_{i} 
\]</span>
is still a linear model. (We’ve just squared the elements of the predictor variables.)</p></li>

<div id="how-to-get-the-coefficients-derivation-of-formulas" class="section level3" number="3.1.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.1.1</span> How to get the coefficients, derivation of formulas</h3>
<p>Here we will go through the derivation of formulas to show how the least squares estimates are obtained. This derivation is not required for the course, but it may be helpful for those who are interested in understanding how the estimates are obtained.</p>
<p>Just to review, if you have regression to the origin, you want a line that’s forced to the origin that has no intercepts. You have the single predictor <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and a single predictor of <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> and you want no intercept, <span class="math inline">\(E[Y_i]=X_{1i}\beta_1\)</span>. The slope estimate was <span class="math inline">\(\sum X_i Y_i / \sum X_i^2\)</span>. Now lets try to derive the least squares estimate when we have two regressors, which can be generalized to models with more variables. In <span class="math inline">\(E[Y_i] = X_{1i}\beta_1 + X_{2i}\beta_2 = \mu_i\)</span>, Least squares tries to minimize:
<span class="math display">\[
\sum_{i=1}^n (Y_i - X_{1i} \beta_1 - X_{2i} \beta_2)^2
\]</span>
Here we try to give a development that is more intuitive than what you would get with something like linear algebra.
<span class="math display">\[\Sum(y_i - X_{0i} \beta_0 - X_{1i} \beta_1\]</span>
Imagine we knew <span class="math inline">\(\beta_1\)</span> or fix <span class="math inline">\(\beta_1\)</span>, then we can write <span class="math inline">\(\tilde y_i = y_i - x_{0i} \beta_0\)</span> and subsequently <span class="math inline">\(\Sum(\tilde y_i - X_{1i} \beta_1\)</span>. This is exactly regression through the origin with just the single regressor. So we can write <span class="math inline">\(\beta_1 = \sum \tilde y_i X_{1i} / \sum X_{1i}^2\)</span>. Now we can plug this back into the original equation and we get:
<span class="math display">\[
\sum_{i=1}^n (Y_i - X_{1i} \beta_1 - X_{2i} \sum \tilde y_i X_{1i} / \sum X_{1i}^2)^2
\]</span>
This is an equation that only involves <span class="math inline">\(\beta_0\)</span> and a regression through the origin for <span class="math inline">\(\beta_0\)</span>. What it works out to be, and this is the interesting part, is that the regression slope for <span class="math inline">\(\beta_0\)</span>, is exactly what you would obtain if you took the residual of <span class="math inline">\(X_1\)</span> out of <span class="math inline">\(X_0\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(X_1\)</span> out of <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> and
then just did regression to the origin.</p>
<p>Multivariable regression calculates the coefficient for <span class="math inline">\(X_0\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\beta_0\)</span>, as if you had removed the effect of <span class="math inline">\(X_1\)</span> from both <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(X_0\)</span>. Similarly, the regression coefficient for <span class="math inline">\(X_1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\beta_1\)</span>, is what you would get if you were to remove the effect of <span class="math inline">\(X_0\)</span> from both <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(X_1\)</span>. This is why multivariable regression is thought of as having adjusted for the other variables.
A coefficient from a multivariable regression is the coefficient where the linear effect of all the other variables on that predictor and response has been removed.</p>

<p><span class="math inline">\(\beta_0\)</span> is what you would get with regression through the origin if you removed the second coefficient <span class="math inline">\(X_1\)</span>.

<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.1.4</span> The general case</h3>
<p>More generally, multivariate regression estimates are exactly those having removed the linear relationship of the other variables from both the regressor and response. Least squares solutions have to minimize<span class="math display">\[\sum_{i=1}^n (Y_i - X_{1i}\beta_1 - \ldots - X_{pi}\beta_p)^2\]</span>. The least squares estimate for the coefficient of a multivariate regression model is exactly regression through the origin with the linear relationships with the other regressors removed from both the regressor and outcome by taking residuals. In this sense, multivariate regression “adjusts” a coefficient for the linear impact of the other variables.</p>

<div id="interpretation-of-coefficients" class="section level3" number="3.1.6">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.1.6</span> Interpretation of coefficients</h3>
<p>The regression predictor, given the collection of covariants take a specific value, <span class="math inline">\(x_1\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(x_p\)</span>, is just the sum of the <span class="math inline">\(x_k\beta_k\)</span>. <span class="math display">\[E[Y | X_1 = x_1, \ldots, X_p = x_p] = \sum_{k=1}^p x_{k} \beta_k\]</span></p>
<p>If one of the predictors, say <span class="math inline">\(X_1\)</span>, is incremented by 1 i.e. <span class="math inline">\(X_1\)</span> instead of <span class="math inline">\(x_1\)</span> takes <span class="math inline">\(x_1+1\)</span>, then the regression coefficient <span class="math inline">\(\beta_1\)</span> is the expected change in the response.
<span class="math display">\[
E[Y | X_1 = x_1 + 1, \ldots, X_p = x_p] = (x_1 + 1) \beta_1 + \sum_{k=2}^p x_{k} \beta_k
\]</span></p>
<p>If we subtract the two terms the expected value of the response from the responce where the first co-efficient takes the value of <span class="math inline">\(x_1 +1\)</span> works out to be <span class="math inline">\(\beta_1\)</span>.
<span class="math display">\[
E[Y | X_1 = x_1 + 1, \ldots, X_p = x_p]  - E[Y | X_1 = x_1, \ldots, X_p = x_p]\]</span>
<span class="math display">\[= (x_1 + 1) \beta_1 + \sum_{k=2}^p x_{k} \beta_k + \sum_{k=1}^p x_{k} \beta_k = \beta_1 \]</span></p>
<p>Notice all the other <span class="math inline">\(x_2\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(x_p\)</span> were held fixed, the interpretation of a multivariate regression coefficient is the expected change in the response per unit change in the regressor, holding all of the other regressors fixed.</p>
<p>The basic components of the linear models are exactly the same as in simple linear regression.</p>
<ul>
<li>Model <span class="math inline">\(Y_i = \sum_{k=1}^p X_{ik} \beta_{k} + \epsilon_{i}\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_i \sim N(0, \sigma^2)\)</span></li>
<li>Fitted responses <span class="math inline">\(\hat Y_i = \sum_{k=1}^p X_{ik} \hat \beta_{k}\)</span></li>
<li>Residuals <span class="math inline">\(e_i = Y_i - \hat Y_i\)</span></li>
<li>Variance estimate <span class="math inline">\(\hat \sigma^2 = \frac{1}{n-p} \sum_{i=1}^n e_i ^2\)</span> (note the <span class="math inline">\(n-p\)</span> degrees of freedom)</li>
<li>To get predicted responses at new values, <span class="math inline">\(x_1, \ldots, x_p\)</span>, simply plug them into the linear model <span class="math inline">\(\sum_{k=1}^p x_{k} \hat \beta_{k}\)</span></li>
<li>Coefficients have standard errors, <span class="math inline">\(\hat \sigma_{\hat \beta_k}\)</span>, and
<span class="math inline">\(\frac{\hat \beta_k - \beta_k}{\hat \sigma_{\hat \beta_k}}\)</span>
follows a <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> distribution with <span class="math inline">\(n-p\)</span> degrees of freedom.</li>
<li>Predicted responses have standard errors and we can calculate predicted and expected response intervals.</li>
</ul>
<p>These should all be pretty familiar because they’re basically the same as what we did for linear aggression, the difference is we have more terms now. Remember in linear aggression we had two terms, we had an intercept and a covariant now we are just adding more covariants potentially.</p>
<p>One point to note is that the variance estimate is not quite the same as the average squared residuals. In linear regression we divided by <span class="math inline">\(n-2\)</span>, now we divide by <span class="math inline">\(n-p\)</span>. That’s kind of a technical point because if you know <span class="math inline">\(n-p\)</span> of the residuals you implicitly know the last <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> of them due to some linear constraints. That’s a minor point you can think of the residuals variants estimate is nothing other than the average square residuals for the most part with <span class="math inline">\(N-p\)</span> part not withstanding.</p>
<p>In a sense all the things we knew about from linear regression carryover to multi-variable regression.</p>
<p>To end this section, we want to emphasize how important linear models are to the data scientist. Before you do any machine learning or any complex algorithm, linear models should be your first attempt. They offer parsimonious and well understood easily describe relationships between predictors and response. There are some modern
machine learning algorithms that can beat some of the properties of linear models, like the imposed linearity. Nonetheless, linear models should always be your starting point. there is some amazing things you can do with linear models that you may not think that would be possible. For example, you can take a time series like a music sound or something like that, and decompose it into its harmonics. This is so-called discrete Fourier transform can be thought of the as the fit from a linear model. You can flexibly fit rather complicated functions and curves and things like that using linear models. You can fit factor variables as predictors. ANOVA and ANCOVA are special cases of linear models. You can uncover complex multivariate relationships within a response and you can build fairly accurate prediction models.</p>

Agriculture is also on the y-axis for the first graph. In addition, the corresponding upper triangular part of the matrix gives the correlation between the two variables.

<p>Tilde period in <code>lm</code> function is a shorthand for all the other variables in the data frame. The output of the <code>summary</code> function gives the coefficients of the model. The first column gives the estimated coefficients, the second column gives the standard errors of the coefficients, the third column gives the t-statistics, and the fourth column gives the p-values. The p-values are the probability of observing a t-statistic as extreme as the one observed, if the true coefficient were 0.</p>
<p>The number <span class="math inline">\(-0.17\)</span> in the <code>Agriculture</code> variable row is interpreted as: we expect a 0.17 decrease, in standardized fertility for every 1% increase in the percentage

<p>The next column, the standard error 0.07, talks about how precise that coefficient is. It talks about the statistical variability of that coefficient. If we wanted to perform a hypothesis test, we would take the estimate, subtract off the hypothesized value, which in this case is zero, and divide it by the standard error of the estimate. Which is the definition of T-statistic. R conveniently provides it to us, -2.448.</p>
<p>We can calculate the probability of getting a t-statistic as extreme as that. As small as negative 2.448 or smaller, and because we are doing a two-sided test,
we would double that p-value. The degrees of freedom are <span class="math inline">\(n - #coefficients\)</span>, including the intercept. But again, R does that on our behalf, and that works out to be 0.018. By standard thresholding rules, type one error rate of say 5%, that would be statistically significant.</p>
<p>In the following section we will see how the process of model selection changes the estimates. We start by contrasting the model with a model that just has agriculture as predictor, the previous model had all the other variables in this predictor.</p>

<p>The agriculture variable is about the same magnitude, 0.19 instead of 0.17 but with changed signs. Instead of agriculture having a negative effect on fertility, it has a positive effect on fertility. Adjusting for the other variables changes the actual direction of the effect of agriculture on fertility. This is the impact of something so-called Simpson’s Paradox. Notice in both cases the agriculture coefficient is strongly statistically significant.
We would like to create (via simulation) an example where an effect can reverse itself. It can help us understand Simpson’s paradox could happen.
Keep in mind, regression is a dynamic process, where you have to think about what variables to include and why. If there hasn’t been randomization to
protect you from confounding, you have to go through a scientific dynamic process of putting confounders in and out and thinking about what they’re
doing to your effective interest in order to evaluate it.</p>

<p>The second regressor, <span class="math inline">\(x_2\)</span>, is the values <span class="math inline">\(1-n\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(x_1\)</span> is a variable that depends on <span class="math inline">\(x_2\)</span> and random noise. Think of <span class="math inline">\(x_2\)</span> as something we might measure regularly, like days, and <span class="math inline">\(x_1\)</span> as something like a saving account where the balance goes up with time and random fluctuations. The random fluctuations impact the spending, so the money doesn’t necessarily always just go up. It goes up and down sporadically, but the linear trend is going up. Let’s assume y is happiness with a measure like <code>y = -x1 + x2 + noise</code>. The true generating model <code>y</code> is negatively associated with <code>-x1</code> suggesting happiness is negatively associated with money and positively associated with <code>x2</code>, so it goes up with time and down with <code>x1</code> with some random normal noise. We know from the model <code>y = -x1 + x2 + noise</code> the outcome depends negatively on <code>x1</code> with a coefficient of minus 1, and depends positively on <code>x2</code> with a coefficient of plus 1. If fit <code>x1</code> by itself we get an enormous coefficient, 95, which is clearly wrong. It’s nothing near to the negative 1 that it’s supposed to be or that we would hope it would be. It is picking up the residual effect of <code>x2</code> that’s a big driver of y, but when we fit the correct model, <code>x1</code> and <code>x2</code>, together we will get the correct coefficients, about minus 1 for <code>x1</code>, and about plus 1 for <code>x2</code>. You can imagine why this would happen by answering: what is regression doing? It’s taking <code>x1</code> and removing the linear effect of <code>x2</code>.</p>
<p>Let’s do some plots to highlight this, just to show us how it works a little bit.</p>

<p>There is a clear positive linear relationship, between the <code>x1</code> and <code>y</code>. However, with x2, which is the color, there is also clear positive gradient. As y goes up, so does x2. And also you can see as x1 goes up, so does x2. So you can see the confounding that’s happening here.</p>

<p>If we plot the residuals you can see that for the residual y and the residual <code>x1</code>, there is a clear negative linear relationship, and if you stare at it enough, you realize that the slope of this line should be around negative 1. You can also see that the <code>x2</code> variable is clearly not related to the residual <code>x1</code> variable.</p>
<p>It is important to remember the above explanation doesn’t mean that throwing every variable into your regression model is the right thing to do. there is consequences to throwing in unnecessary variables. It can make your model less interpretable, it can make your model less stable, and it can make your model less generalizable. It’s important to think about what variables you’re putting in and why.</p>
<p>In the earlier example about Swiss data the agriculture effect reversed itself after we included the other variables in the model. You will find that this happens quite a bit when education and examination are included. Educational attainment is negatively correlated with the percent working in agriculture, a correlation of -0.64. In addition, education and examination are kind of measuring the same thing. Their correlation, those two variables is 0.7. The percent of males in the province working in agriculture is negatively related to educational attainment (correlation of -0.6395225) and Education and Examination (correlation of 0.6984153) are obviously measuring similar things. The question is: is the positive marginal an artifact for not having accounted for, say, Education level? (Education does have a stronger effect, by the way.)
At the minimum, anyone claiming that provinces that are more agricultural have higher fertility rates would immediately be open to criticism.</p>
<p><em>Notice</em>
What if we include an unnecessary variable?
Here we introduce <code>z</code> which adds no new linear information, since it’s a linear combination of variables already included. R just drops terms that are linear combinations of other terms.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.2.1</span> Dummy variables are smart</h3>
<p>You might be surprised to find out how flexible linear regression models are. For example, you can fit factor variables as regressors and come up with things like
analysis of variance as a special case of linear models.</p>
<p>Consider the linear model <span class="math inline">\(Y_i = \beta_0 + X_{i1} \beta_1 + \epsilon_{i}\)</span> where each <span class="math inline">\(X_{i1}\)</span> is binary so that it is a 1 if measurement <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> is in a group and 0 otherwise. (Treated versus not in a clinical trial, for example.) The estimated mean for the treated group is the mean of the people who are treated. Then for people in the treated group we can write <span class="math inline">\(E[Y_i] = \beta_0 + \beta_1\)</span>. <span class="math inline">\(\beta_1\)</span> is interpreted as the increase, or decrease if it’s negative, in the mean response for those that were treated.
Similarly for people without treatment we have <span class="math inline">\(E[Y_i] = \beta_0\)</span>.</p>
<p>The LS fits work out to be <span class="math inline">\(\hat \beta_0 + \hat \beta_1\)</span> is the mean for those in the group and <span class="math inline">\(\hat \beta_0\)</span> is the mean for those not in the group.
You see that linear regression provides the fitted values and tell you about the means for both of the groups, in addition it gives you an inference for comparing the two groups automatically.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> including a binary variable that is 1 for those not in the group would be redundant. It would create three parameters to describe two means.</p>
<p>We can generalize this to more than two groups. If we have a three-level variable, we can create two binary variables, one for each level, and then we can compare the means of the three groups. For example, imagine you have some outcome but you want to compare it to U.S. political party affiliation. In this case, let’s say you were only considering those who were Democrats, Republicans, or registered Independents. Well, you can do that by having a variable X1, that’s one for Republicans and zero for otherwise, a variable X2 that’s one for Democrats and zero for otherwise, we omit the X3 for Independents because of redundancy. If we know that you’re not Republican and not a Democrat, then you must be an Independent in our data set the way we’ve set things up and having a third variable wouldn’t have any new information.
<span class="math display">\[Y_i = \beta_0 + X_{i1} \beta_1 + X_{i2} \beta_2 + \epsilon_i\]</span>
The mean for the three groups are:
* If <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> is Republican <span class="math inline">\(E[Y_i] = \beta_0 +\beta_1\)</span>
* If <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> is Democrat <span class="math inline">\(E[Y_i] = \beta_0 + \beta_2\)</span>.
* If <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> is Independent <span class="math inline">\(E[Y_i] = \beta_0\)</span>.</p>
<p>If we compare the means like <span class="math inline">\(\beta_0\)</span> the mean for the Independents versus <span class="math inline">\(\beta_0 +\beta_1\)</span> the mean for the Republicans, i.e. subtract those two, we get <span class="math inline">\(\beta_1\)</span>. Which means <span class="math inline">\(\beta_1\)</span> compares Republicans to Independents, and similarly <span class="math inline">\(\beta_2\)</span> compares Democrats to Independents and <span class="math inline">\(\beta_1 - \beta_2\)</span> compares Republicans to Democrats. By omitting the regression variable for the Independents, the intercept became the value for the Independents, and all of the other coefficients have become interpreted relative to Independents and shows choice of reference category changes the interpretation. If we had included the regressor for
Independents and excluded the one for Republicans, then the intercept would be for Republicans, and the coefficient in front of the Democratic would be Democrats versus Republicans. The coefficient in front of the Independent would be Independent versus Republican. To illustrate how this works we move to R.
In this example we look at a factor variable and see how R is treating it the dataset is <code>InsectSprays</code> and we are going to fit a linear model to it.</p>

<p><code>Y</code> is the count, the number of insects, <code>X</code> is the spray. We use a violin plot to show the data, which is kind of like a histogram but sort of tilted on its side and repeated on both sides so it looks a little like a violin. It looks like a violin if you’re data cooperates, otherwise, it looks like a blob. As you can see there are eight spray A, B, C, D, E, and F and you can see the insect counts. It’s unfortunate they’re not telling us whether or not the count is the count of
the number of alive or the number dead insects. So we don’t know if this is a better spray or a worse spray. However, we still can test the difference between different factor levels in this case using linear models. Wwhen we include insect spray as a linear model and y as an outcome.</p>

<p>We get the Intercept, spray B, spray C, spray D, spray E, and spray F, notice that spray A is conspicuously missing. The idea is that everything here is in comparison with spray A. So, 0.833 is the change in the mean between spray B and spray A. In this case, 14.5 is the mean for spray A. You can double check that by looking at the plot. Spray B seems reasonable affected by a little bit from spray A, whereas spray C looks like it’s affected a lot it has a coefficient of <span class="math inline">\(-12\)</span>.
If we wanted to compare spray B and spray C we would have to look at <span class="math inline">\(0.833 - (-12.416)\)</span>. We wouldn’t have a standard error for that comparison immediately. However, that would give us the estimate.</p>
<p>If we were to take the average count for the sprays, for those with spray A, we would get 14.5 with spray B we would get <span class="math inline">\(14.5 + 0.833\)</span>.
What R does is it picks the spray level that’s the lowest alphanumerically, in this case, spray level A, to set as the reference level. Here we like to show you how you can hard code the same model and not rely on R to pick the reference level.</p>

<p>Here <code>count</code> is the outcome and we create a variable using the <code>I</code> function which performs the operation inside the regression, inside the model statement. We look at the instances where the spray is equal to B then multiply that by 1 to change it from Boolean to numeric and do the same for the other sprays and add them all together. In this example we included all of the sprays except A which means we forced A to be the reference level. The result is identical to R picking the reference level as we expected.</p>
<p>What happens if we include spray A?</p>

<p>Notice it gives an NA in front of the spray A coefficient. We have six means, for six sprays and seven parameters in intercept.</p>
<p>If we do want the coefficients, instead of being interpreted as levels referenced to a control level be the mean for each of the groups? Well, we can do that by removing the intercept.</p>

<p>Here <code>count</code> is the outcome and spray is the predictor, but we remove the intercept.
Notice we get a different set of coefficients, one for each spray level. It includes A, B, C, D, E and F without dropping any levels. It can do that because it has six parameters, and six means to work with. The coefficients are exactly equal to the means for each spray in the data. If calculated the means for each spray it would work out to be the same numbers.</p>
<p>We want to emphasize this model is no different than the previous model that included an intercept, and just the coefficients have a different interpretation. If we add these together, 14.5 and 0.833 from the model with intercept we should get the mean for spray B, which is the case. In the model with the intercept, the intercept is interpreted as the spray A mean and all the coefficients are interpreted as relative to spray A differences from spray A and when we fit the data without the intercept we get the mean for each spray.
The p values are testing whether or not, A is different from B, and A is different from C, and A is different from D, and so on, whereas the p values from
the model without intercept are testing whether or not those means are different from 0, which is a very different test. We were trying to illustrate how you play around with factor variables in <code>lm</code> is very important in terms of how you interpret it. It’s not just a conceptual or theoretical thing to worry about it is a very practical thing. What your intercept means changes dramatically depending on what your reference level is.</p>
<p>One more thing that we want to discuss is the idea of re-leveling. You can re-level to have differenct reference level. For example, if you want to compare spray C to spray A, you can re-level the spray variable to have C as the reference level.</p>

<ul>
<li>If we treat Spray as a factor, R includes an intercept and omits the alphabetically first level of the factor.
<ul>
<li>All t-tests are for comparisons of Sprays versus Spray A.</li>
<li>Empirical mean for A is the intercept.</li>
<li>Other group means are the itc plus their coefficient.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>If we omit an intercept, then it includes terms for all levels of the factor.
<ul>
<li>Group means are the coefficients.</li>
<li>Tests are tests of whether the groups are different than zero. (Are the expected counts zero for that spray.)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>If we want comparisons between, Spray B and C, say we could refit the model with C (or B) as the reference level.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note</strong> We want to make a few points about the InsectSprays dataset, which we believe is important for the data scientist.</p>
<ul>
<li>Counts are bounded from below by 0, violates the assumption of normality of the errors.
<ul>
<li>Also there are counts near zero, so both the actual assumption and the intent of the assumption are violated.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Variance does not appear to be constant.</li>
<li>Perhaps taking logs of the counts would help.
<ul>
<li>There are 0 counts, so maybe log(Count + 1)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Also, we’ll cover Poisson GLMs for fitting count data.</li>
</ul>
<p>In this section we go through an example that underlies the topic of so called ANCOVA. In this example we will fit multiple lines with different intercepts and different slopes. We will use the swiss dataset, recall we are trying to model fertilities as a linear function of agriculture, which is the percent of that province that was working in agriculture.</p>

<p>For the time being, we will ignore the outlaiers and simply work on fitting a line where we want two separate lines. One for the majority Catholic provinces, and one for the majority Protestant provinces. For notations <code>Y</code> is fertility, <code>X1</code> is the percent of the province working in agriculture, and <code>X2</code> is a binary variable, where it is one if the province is over 50% catholic, and zero if the province is majority Protestant. Let’s consider model one, where we modeled the expected y, given x1 and x2, is an intercept plus a slope times x1. <span class="math inline">\(E[Y | X_1 = x_1, X_2 = 0] = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1\)</span>. This is the line that would disregard the religion of the province entirely. Let’s consider a second model <span class="math inline">\(E[Y | X_1 = x_1, X_2 = 1] = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2\)</span>.
In the event that X two is equal to zero, i.e. if the province is majority protestant, this works out to be <span class="math inline">\(\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1\)</span>. In the event that x2 is equal to one, i.e. if the province is majority Catholic, this works out to be <span class="math inline">\(\beta_0 + \beta_2 + \beta_1 x_1\)</span>.</p>
<p>The model that includes X1 and X2, but no interaction fits two models that have the same slope, but they have different intercepts, <span class="math inline">\(\beta_0\)</span> and then <span class="math inline">\(\beta_0+\beta_2\)</span>. If we consider one third model <span class="math inline">\(E[Y | X_1 = x_1, X_2 = 1] = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + \beta_3 x_1 x_2\)</span>, in this model when X2 is zero, it works out to be <span class="math inline">\(\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1\)</span>, and when X2 is 1, which is the case when the province is majority Catholic, we get <span class="math inline">\(\beta_0 + \beta_2 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_3 x_1\)</span>, now let’s reorganize terms to get <span class="math inline">\(\beta_0 + \beta_2 + (\beta_1 + \beta_3) x_1\)</span>.</p>
<p>This model is showing if we omitted that interaction term, we fit two lines the same slope, if we include the interaction term, we get two lines different slopes and different intercepts. And the coefficient in front of the Catholic term is going to change in the intercept going from Protestant to Catholic.</p>

<p>Because the variable <code>CatholicBin</code> is 0 or 1, we don’t actually have to have the factor statement. Because coding a variable of 0 versus 1 treats it as a factor. However we like to call factor variables and the reason is sometimes you have a variable like 0,1,2 for a 3 level variable, and if you don’t call that a factor, R is going to treat that as a continuous regressor. It’s going to say 2 is twice 1, even if 2 is just a numeric coding for representing red hair color and 1 is for brown hair color, where 2 really has nothing to do with being twice 1 in that case.</p>

<p>We have an intercept and a slope, this intercept is the intercept for mostly Protestant provinces, the slope is the slope for mostly Protestant provinces. This 2.86 plus 62.04 is the intercept for the mostly Catholic provinces and the slope 0.096 + 0.089 is the slope for the mostly Catholic provinces. For lines with different intercepts and different slopes depending on the percent of the province that is Catholic, put an asterisk and do the fit. What happens when you add an asterisks in between two variables in R? It automatically fits the interaction. In general you want to include the main effects, if you include the interaction.</p>

based on the coefficients all the Catholic terms were positive the line with the slightly higher intercept is the Catholic line and the line for the slightly lower
intercept is the mostly Protestant. Now you can probably see that well for the blue dots it is not clear how the two outlier blue dots impacting the fit, so we might want to investigate that. We will do that in the next section where we talk about residuals and influence diagnostics and that sort of thing.</p>

<div id="adjustment" class="section level2" number="3.3">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.3</span> Adjustment</h2>
<p>Adjustment, is the idea of putting regressors into a linear model to investigate the role of a third variable on the relationship between another two. Since it is often the case that a third variable can distort, or confound if you will, the relationship between two others.</p>
<p>As an example, consider looking at lung cancer rates and breath mint usage. For the sake of completeness, imagine if you were looking at forced expiratory volume (a measure of lung function) and breath mint usage. If you found a statistically significant regression relationship, it wouldn’t be wise to rush off to the newspapers with the headline “Breath mint usage causes shortness of breath!”, for a variety of reasons. First off, even if the association is sound, you don’t know that it’s causal. But, more importantly in this case, the likely culprit is smoking habits. Smoking rates are likely related to both breath mint usage rates and lung function. How would you defend your finding against the accusation that it’s just variability in smoking habits?</p>
<p>If your finding held up among non-smokers and smokers analyzed separately, then you might have something. In other words, people wouldn’t even begin to believe this finding unless it held up while holding smoking status constant. That is the idea of adding a regression variable into a model as adjustment. The coefficient of interest is interpreted as the effect of the predictor on the response, holding the adjustment variable constant.</p>
<p>In this lecture, we’ll use simulation to investigate how adding a regressor into a model addresses the idea of adjustment.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.3.1</span> Adjustment Examples</h3>
<p>In this section, we are gonna go over some examples of how adjusting for one variable can impact the apparent relationship of another variable on an outcome. The easiest way to see this is to look at a two group variable. For example, a treatment versus a control or something you might see in an AB test when we are adjusting for a continuous variable. Here’s the first simulation:</p>

<p>In this case, the red group was the group reciving treatment and the blue group was control. The horizontal lines show the marginal effect of group status disregarding the x. The y was a measure of blood pressure, then we would think that if we hadn’t factored in x, the mean for the group that received the treatment was around 2 and the mean for the control was around 0.8. You notice there is a pretty clear linear relationship between the outcome and the regressor. So what we could do is fit a model that looks like <span class="math inline">\(y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 T + \beta_2 x + \epsilon\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> is the treatment indicator, with values of <span class="math inline">\(\{0,1\}\)</span>. This would fit two parallel lines with <span class="math inline">\(\beta_1\)</span> representing the change in intercepts between the groups and <span class="math inline">\(\beta_2\)</span> the common slope that exists across the two groups.
<img src="resources/images/Week03_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-27-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Taking a closer look at y-axis shows the marginal effect, the effect that we have if we disregard x, and the effect that we have if we incorporate x in a linear model and look at the change in the intercepts, are about the same. In addition, note in this example there is a lot of direct evidence to compare the groups for
any given value of x. If we binned x we would have red and blue circles for a direct comparison of the treatment for kind of a fairly isolated level of x.</p>

<p>The horizontal lines show marginal difference between the red, treated group, and the blue, control group. However, if we fit that model and look at the change in the intercepts, we’d see a tiny difference. This is a case where we would go from a massive treatment effect to nothing when we accounted for x. Moreover, if we knew that the x value was one or smaller, we know that value is in the blue group, and if it was 1.5 or higher, we know the value was in the treated group. So knowledge of x at some level pretty much gives us perfect knowledge of received treatment. In a randomized setuation it would be very hard to pick what treatment you had based on your x level because the x levels were all jumbled up some of the high x levels went to the treated, some of the high x levels went to the control. However, in this case, we clearly didn’t randomize. The question of which model here is the right one to consider is not the discussion for this section, here we want to show how the inclusion of x can change the estimate.
As an example, imagin y, your outcome, was the blood pressure and the x variable was cholesterol or something highly related to whether or not you would’ve gotten prescribed a medication. You could see that adjusting for x is really just adjusting for the same thing that would lead you to have treatment. Again, this is what makes observational data analysis very hard as opposed to instances where you have randomized sample. This is an example where we had a strong marginal effect when we disregarded x, and a very subtle or a non-existent effect when we accounted for x. One more point is there is no value of x we can hold constant and compare red versus blue directly, which is a bad setting, where we are relying very heavily on the model to compare the group.</p>
<p>A summary of the important points about the previous example can be listed as:
* The X variable is highly related to group status
* The X variable is related to Y, the intercept doesn’t depend on the group variable.
* The X variable remains related to Y holding group status constant
* The group variable is marginally related to Y disregarding X.
* The model would estimate no adjusted effect due to group.
* There isn’t any data to inform the relationship between group and Y.

<p>There is some direct evidence for comparing the two groups. The marginal mean for the red and blue groups suggests the red is higher than the blue. However, the linear fit in the intercepts shows the blue is higher than the red. This shows the adjusted estimate is significant and the exact opposite of the unadjusted estimate. This phenomenon is often called Simpson’s Paradox, and the idea is things can change to the exact opposite when you perform adjustment.</p>

<p>Here there is no marginal effect. However, there is a huge effect when we adjust for x. there is no simple rule that says this is always what will happen with adjustment. Pretty much any permutation of going from significant to non-significant, staying both significant, staying non-significant, flipping signs can occur.</p>

<p>This example considers an instance where assuming the slopes were common across the two groups would be wrong. The linear model <span class="math inline">\(y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 T + \beta_2 x + \beta_3 T x + \epsilon\)</span> would fit two lines with different intercepts and different slopes. Another important thing to ascertain is there is no treatment effect.</p>
<p>If we look at the center there is no evidence of a treatment effect, if we look at the right side of the graph there is a big evidence that blue has a higher outcome than red, and if you look at the left side we see there is a lot of evidence that red has a higher outcome than blue. The interaction is the reason why the main treatment effect doesn’t have a lot of meaning and the coefficient in front of the treated effects is not interpreted as the treatment effect by itself. The treatment effect depends on what level of x you’re at, and you can’t just read the term from the regression output associated with the treatment and act as if it’s a treatment effect because we have an interaction term in the model. Again this shows how adjustment can really change things if you have a setting where you have not just adjustment, but so-called modification.</p>
<p>We want to reiterate that nothing we’ve talked about is specific to having a binary treatment and a continuous x.</p>

<p>The above plot shows outcome, y, and the continuous variable <span class="math inline">\(x1\)</span> and continuous variable <span class="math inline">\(x2\)</span> color coded, higher lighter values mean higher, and more red darker values means lower. At first glance you might say there is not much of a relationship between y and x1, however, if we look at it in three dimensions you can see that most of the variation of y is explained by its relationship with x2. Here we show the 2D plot of y versus x2.

<p>An easy way to look at the other variables effect without having to resort to three dimensional plots, which don’t work if you move beyond two variables is to look at residuals.</p>

<p>Here we show the residual of y after having removed x2, the linear effect of x2, and the residual of x1 having removed linear effect of x2. As you can see there is
a very strong relationship left over between y and x1 after having removed the effect of x2.</p>
<p>We want to reiterate we haven’t said what exactly is the right model, the best way to think about that is you have to bring in some of the specific subject matter, or clinical scientific subject matter expertise into your model building exercise. If you’re doing model building with a regular data set where you want interpretable
coefficients getting the team of people some with the right scientific expertise, some with the statistical expertise, and some with the computing expertise is essential.</p>

<p>Recall from before that the vertical distances between the observed data points and the fitted regression line are called residuals. We can generalize this idea to the vertical distances between the observed data and the fitted surface in multivariable settings.</p>
<p>We will start with the model, <span class="math inline">\(Y_i = \sum_{k=1}^p X_{ik} \beta_j + \epsilon_{i}\)</span>. Through out this section we will assume errors are normally distribute. We defined the residuals as <span class="math inline">\(e_i = Y_i - \hat Y_i = Y_i - \sum_{k=1}^p X_{ik} \hat \beta_j\)</span>, and the estimate of residual variation as <span class="math inline">\(\hat \sigma^2 = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n e_i^2}{n-p}\)</span>, the <span class="math inline">\(n-p\)</span> so that <span class="math inline">\(E[\hat \sigma^2] = \sigma^2\)</span>. Where we divide by n-p rather than n, for unbiasness. In R we can get a plot of the residuals and several plots that measure aspects of model fit and lack of model fit. Let’s load up the data set swiss and fit the linear model that includes all the terms, using a period after the tilde symbol will include all terms.</p>

<p>In this plot there is a clear linear relationship between the predictor and the response. However, there are four points in orange that we would like to discuss. The first at the lower left hand side is right in the middle of the cloud of data. It doesn’t really have much influence or leverage. Remember that the line has to go
through the average of the y’s and the average of the axis,.In that sense think of the averages as a mid point of fulcrum and that the bar namely the regression line has to move through that fulcrum and like a regular physical fulcrum, that point will have more leverage as you move further out.
<img src="resources/images/Week03_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-37-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>The force to hold the system in balance is higher if we apply in red arrow position and lower if we apply on blue arrow position. The same analogy happens in regression models, if we have a bunch of data, a datapoint that’s far outside of the natural range of the axis would have high leverage and a data point that is right in the middle of the x’s will have low leverage. The concept of leverage is merely a concept of how far away from the center of the axis the data point is. Influence on the other hand is whether or not that point chooses to exert that leverage.</p>

<p>Going back to the plot we created before, the point on the upper right side has high leverage, but it opts not to execute that leverage. On the other hand the lower right hand point, if it was included in the regression line it would probably have a larger effect on it. Because it’s outside of the cloud of points and it also doesn’t adhere to what the rest of the date is saying, we can say this point has high leverage and high influence. One final point to discuss is the upper left point that is in the middle of the cloud or the X values, it has low leverage; however, it doesn’t adhere at all to the relationship meaning while being an outlier, it is not going to exert the same influence on the model that the lower right point is going to.</p>
<p>The idea of calling something an outlier is actually very vague. We want to make the term a little bit more precise. Ourselves outliers can be the result of real or spurious processes. If it is a spurious process we want to remove that point from our fitted model and if it is part of a real process, we don’t want to get rid of a point. We mentioned when outliers can conform to the regression relationship and when they can not. A fairly complete list of default diagnostic measures can be done by the R command <code>?influence.measures</code> and this will give you a list of potential influence measures. The measures include:
* <code>rstandard</code> - standardized residuals, residuals divided by their standard deviations
* <code>rstudent</code> - standardized residuals, residuals divided by their standard deviations, where the ith data point was deleted in the calculation of the standard deviation for the residual to follow a t distribution
* <code>hatvalues</code> - measures of leverage (measure of influence)
* <code>dffits</code> - change in the predicted response when the <span class="math inline">\(i^{th}\)</span> point is deleted in fitting the model.
* <code>dfbetas</code> - change in individual coefficients when the <span class="math inline">\(i^{th}\)</span> point is deleted in fitting the model.
* <code>cooks.distance</code> - overall change in teh coefficients when the <span class="math inline">\(i^{th}\)</span> point is deleted.
* <code>resid</code> - returns the ordinary residuals
* <code>resid(fit) / (1 - hatvalues(fit))</code> where <code>fit</code> is the linear model fit returns the PRESS residuals, i.e. the leave one out cross validation residuals - the difference in the response and the predicted response at data point <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>, where it was not included in the model fitting.</p>
<p>One way which hatvalues are tremendously useful is in finding data entry errors. You might look through the collection of rows of the data and look at the associated hatvalues, if you see some are extremely large not only would they potentially impact the model, but you should look at that row to ascertain whether there
was a data entry error. To measuer the actual influence, not just the potential influence, we take out that data point refit the model, and then compare the models with and without the datapoint. <code>dffits</code> tracks how much the fitted value at that X value changes depending on whether or not that point was included. The dfbetas look specifically at the slope coefficients, for the <code>dffits</code> we get one dffit per data point. On the other hand, the <code>dfbetas</code> we get a dfbeta for every coefficient for every data points, if we have a model, with two coefficients, the intercept and the slope <code>dfbetas</code> will be a matrix of two by the number of datapoints. The <code>cooks.distance</code> is just an overall change in the coefficients. In a sense it summarizes the <code>dfbetas</code>. The PRESS residuals are less specifically useful for detecting outliers and determining influence than they are for ascertaining things like module fit, but we put it here because it’s related.</p>
<p>How do we use all of these things?
Be wary of simplistic rules for diagnostic plots and measures. It’s better to understand what they are trying to accomplish and use them judiciously. If you’re digging deep into a data analysis, you really want to not think of these in terms of simple thresholding rules for declaring things an outlier. You want to take a more wholistic approach. Like look at the collective residuals relative to the other residuals, look at the collection of hat values
relative to the other hat values. Not all of the measures have meaningful absolute scales. You can look at them relative to the values across the data. An important aspect of all these measures is that they probe the data to look at lack of influence, and whether or not something is an outlier in separate ways. So you want to really think of them as diagnostics in the same way a physicians thinks of diagnostics to try and figure out if there is any problem. Patterns in residual plots generally indicate some poor aspect of model fit like heteroskedasticity (non constant variance), missing model terms, temporal patterns (plot residuals versus collection order). Residual QQ plots investigate normality of the errors. Leverage measures (hat values) can be useful for diagnosing data entry errors and finally influence measures get to the bottom line, ‘how does deleting or including this point impact a particular aspect of the model’.</p>

<p>The diagnostic values of <code>dfbetas</code> for the first point, which was the outlying point. It’s still large but nowhere near as large as in the previous case. It appears to have some influence in the fit, but nothing like in the previous case. However, the hat values has a much larger hat value than and the remaining points. It is because the point is outside of the range of the X values, but it adheres to the direction relationship meaning it will have a large leverage value but not a large <code>dfbetas</code> value.</p>

<p>Earlier we started out with this now we want to interpret these. The residual plot versus the fitted values is trying to find anything that’s systematic. There doesn’t seem to be too many aspects of absence of model departures there. The Q-Q plot is specifically designed to test normality. The Scale-Location plot is plotting
the standardized residuals, which are the ordinary residuals but standardize. This is a lot like the residual plot, you’re applying them against the fitted values but, now have changed the scale. That’s potentially useful for looking at the across different experiments. The final one is plot of the Residuals vs Leverage. These are a couple of examples of the kind of plots you might want to look at in this dataset none of them seem too inherently bad.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.5</span> Model selection</h2>
<p>These lectures represents a challenging question: “How do we chose what variables to include in a regression model?”. Sadly, no single easy answer exists and the most reasonable answer would be “It depends.”. These concepts bleed into ideas of machine learning, which is largely focused on high dimensional variable selection and weighting. In the following lectures we cover some of the basics and, most importantly, the consequences of over- and under-fitting a model.</p>
<p>In this part, we will talk about the process of model fitting when you have lots of variables in a regression context. An important point is to distinguish between
multivariable regression and the prediction. In prediction we are less concerned with interpretability so we are far more tolerant for complex models and automated search algorithms and rules to come up with the best prediction with respect to a specific loss function. In contrast, in a lot of regression examples, we want simple interpretable models. That means we are going to place a heavy emphasis on the idea of parsimony, which is finding the simplest model to explain what we are looking at, as simple as possible, but no simpler. If a variable in a regression model explains a tiny bit extra about a variation but really harms the interpretability, we are going to omit that variable. Any model that teaches you something valuable about your data is right, as long as it teaches you something true. There are uncountably many ways that our model can be wrong and lead us astray. In this section we will discuss some basics of what happens when we either
include unnecessary regressors or exclude the important regressors. A qoute by Donald Rumsfeld <em>There are known knowns. These are things we know that we know. There are known unknowns. That is to say, there are things that we know we don’t know. But there are also unknown unknowns. There are things we don’t know we don’t know.</em> is a good way to start this section. There are known knowns, these are things we know that we know. Then there are known unknowns that is to say, there are things that we know we don’t know. But there are also unknown unknowns. There are things we don’t know we don’t know. This quote was heavily criticized, but for regression it makes a lot of sense. Known knowns are regressors that we know we should include in our model and we have recorded so we just put them in. There are known unknowns, and these are the things that we know we should include in our regression model, but unfortunately we didn’t collect them. And there are unknown unknowns and these are things that we should include in our regression model, but we didn’t collect them or don’t know whether or not they’re important.</p>
<p>Some general rules for our known knowns, unknown unknowns, and known unknowns:
* Omitting variables results in bias in the coeficients of interest - unless their regressors are uncorrelated with the omitted ones.
* This is why we randomize treatments, it attempts to uncorrelate our treatment indicator with variables that we don’t have to put in the model.
* (If there is too many unobserved confounding variables, even randomization won’t help you.)
* Including variables that we shouldn’t have increases standard errors of the regression variables.
* Actually, including any new variables increasese (actual, not estimated) standard errors of other regressors. So we don’t want to idly throw variables into the model.
* The model must tend toward perfect fit as the number of non-redundant regressors approaches <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>.
* <span class="math inline">\(R^2\)</span> increases monotonically as more regressors are included.
* The SSE decreases monotonically as more regressors are included.</p>
<p>Remember if there is too many confounded then even randomization is not going to help you. So that means omitting variables that are important, wil have negative impact on our regression model fit. Including variables that are unimportant will not have bias issue; however, they will inflate standard error. Additionally, some
of the model terms, like, R squared are not necessarily good ways to adjudicate between looking at different models with different regressors. The reason with R squared is as you put in a bunch of new regressors, it’s guaranteed to go up no matter what. In the sum of the squared errors, the mean squared error is guaranteed to go down in regression as you include more regressors.
Here is an example where we simulated a bunch of data and redid the simulation for every number of regressors and included them into the model. It shows the R squared going up even though all we are doing is generating a bunch of random normal vectors and putting them into a regression model.</p>

<p>We are interested in the standard deviation of the simulated estimated coefficients. The reason we do this by simulation is the variance inflation occurs on the actual standard errors, not the estimated standard errors. This is sort of the ideal setting, where the three regressors don’t have anything to do with one another. What you see is the standard deviation of the <span class="math inline">\(\beta_1\)</span> coefficients we get across all simulations. They are about same and nothing that bad. The variance inflation by including the extra variables was negligible. The reason is because x2 and x3, have nothing to do x1. We simulated them independently.</p>
<p>In the following case x2 and x3 are heavily dependent on x1.</p>

<p>As expected we see huge amounts of variance inflation, especially for the third model where we include x2 and x3. The general rule is that the more correlated the covariates are to the regressors that you’re interested in, the worse off you’re going to be in terms of paying a penalty for increased standard deviation. For example, if we have diastolic blood pressure data in the model, and we put systolic blood pressure in the model, which is relatively the same thing it is going
to make the diastolic blood pressure standard error increase. Another example is if you had height in a model and then you also included weight then you just have to bite the bullet and deal with the extra standard deviation. However, if it’s unnecessary then you don’t want to include weight. If we omit variables that are important, we get bias. If we include variables that are unnecessary, we inflate standard errors. Especially if we include variables that are unnecessary and are correlated with our variable of interest. This again reiterates why randomization is so important it randomizes across the other variables, the known and unknown knowns that we would otherwise need to include in the model, so that we can only include the treatment of interest. The things that we feel we have to include should be relatively balanced, or relatively uncorrelated with the treatment because it has been randomized. To avoid the undesirable increase in variance that would occur otherwise, randomization becomes crucial. This is why randomization holds such significance. Now, let’s delve into the concept of variance inflation factors. Since we lack knowledge of the actual sigma, precise calculation of variance inflation is not feasible. It relies on the true residual variance, which remains unknown. However, by comparing their ratios, we can eliminate the sigma variable and generate metrics such as ratios and variance inflation. These metrics accurately portray the extent to which standard deviation experiences inflation or remains unaffected. A widely used metric is the Variance Inflation Factor (VIF). Essentially, VIF is a comparison, specifically the ratio, of the variance inflation stemming from the existing data. This comparison involves examining the standard error in your dataset against the hypothetical scenario where all other covariates of interest are orthogonal or, in simpler terms, uncorrelated. Recall that in an ideal situation where all other variables are uncorrelated with your area of interest, minimal variance inflation is observed. The variance inflation factor assesses the current scenario in comparison to the ideal scenario where your area of interest is uncorrelated with all other variables. This factor is crucial for understanding the extent of variance inflation. Additionally, a simulation is provided to illustrate how these ratios can be estimated, although the details of the simulation are not presented here.</p>

<p>We plan to fit the model to explore what occurs if there is a residual effect of the first aspirin when administering the second one. The model will include all variables, denoted by ‘~.’ in the fitting process. Subsequently, we will use the <code>vif(fit)</code> function to obtain the variance inflation factors. Please ensure that you load the required <code>library(car)</code> before proceeding. In the output, the first line displays the variance inflation factor, while the line below presents its square root. Let’s focus on the first line initially, as it is the more conventional approach. For instance, the variance inflation factor for agriculture is 2. This implies that the standard error for the agriculture effect is double what it would be if it were orthogonal to all other regressors. Some factors exhibit high inflation, like examination with a factor of 3.67, almost four times the instance when orthogonal to other regressors. Notably, education and examination are highly related, leading to their elevated variance inflation factors. Consider variables like infant mortality, which has a notably low variance inflation factor. Infant mortality is largely unrelated to other variables, resulting in a minimal inflation factor. This insight provides a glimpse into the impact of including unnecessary variables, where variance inflation factors prove to be valuable tools.</p>
<p>Up until now, our focus has been on the influence of included or excluded variables on regression coefficients. However, there’s another crucial parameter in regression models: the residual variance (sigma squared). Assuming independent and identically distributed errors in our linear model, we can mathematically describe the consequences of omitting or including unnecessary variables. This follows a similar logic to our prior discussion underfitting the model, omitting important variables, leads to biased variance estimates. Because we have attributed to variations that are actually systematically explained by the co-variants
that we have omitted. Conversely, if we correctly fit the model by including all relevant terms, or if we overfit the model, the variance estimates remain unbiased. However, including unnecessary variables inflates the variance of the variance estimate. Essentially, the same rule applies here as it did with coefficients: omitting variables leads to bias, while including them results in less reliable estimates. This illustrates a similar impact across both scenarios.</p>
<p>Let’s shift our focus to model selection in general, particularly automated model selection. Initially, we will fit the model with all variables included. This topic, once primarily within the domain of statistics, has largely transitioned into machine learning field. Even for relatively straightforward linear regression models, the space of potential model terms expands rapidly, especially with the inclusion of interactions and polynomial terms. When faced with numerous regressors and the need to streamline this space, techniques such as factor analysis and principal component analysis become invaluable. However, they come with trade-offs; the interpretability of the obtained principal components or factors may be diminished compared to the original data. It’s worth noting that extensive model discussion can often be circumvented with good design practices. Randomization, for instance, can mitigate many issues by ensuring that the variable of interest remains unrelated to unwanted nuisance variables. Additionally, strategies like stratification and randomization within strata can serve similar purposes, addressing potential sources of bias or confounding. The classic example of the importance of experimental design dates back to R.A. Fisher’s work in field crop experiments. In this context, if one were testing different types of seeds, blocking on various areas of the field was crucial. This involved systematically distributing different seeds across the field while incorporating randomization within that design. Experimental design, as illustrated by Fisher’s field crop experiments, is a broad and impactful topic. In biostatistics, a field with frequent applications of experimental design, the cross-over design is commonly employed. This design aims to use each subject as their own control. For instance, in a study comparing two types of aspirin, participants may receive both aspirins at different times, ensuring that each person is compared to themselves. This control strategy helps mitigate biases that might arise from differences between groups. Considerations for experimental design also extend to addressing potential residual effects, as seen in the example of the second aspirin’s impact after the first one. Strategies such as implementing a washout period may be employed to handle such scenarios. Despite these nuances, the overarching goal of experimental design is to compare individuals with themselves, controlling for intrinsic factors. The significance of thoughtful experimental design becomes evident in its ability to alleviate the complexities associated with model building. By strategically planning and executing experiments, researchers can minimize the need for extensive model considerations that would arise in an observational data collection approach.</p>
<p>One automated search model technique that proves to be quite useful involves examining nested models. This approach is particularly handy when you’re focused on a specific variable, such as a treatment, and are keen on understanding how other collected variables may impact it. The idea is to create nested models, where each successive model incorporates all the terms of the previous one. This strategy facilitates easy testing of each model, providing insights into the necessity of including additional terms. Here’s an example using R to demonstrate nested model testing with three linear models fitted to the SWF dataset:</p>

<p>In this example, we fit models with increasing complexity, starting with a model including only the variable of interest (Agriculture) and gradually adding other relevant variables. The ANOVA function is then used to test whether the inclusion of additional terms is necessary. The output provides information about the models, including degrees of freedom, residual sums of squares, and excess degrees of freedom when moving from one model to the next. By calculating the S statistic and associated P values, you can determine if the inclusion of specific terms is necessary at each stage. This approach allows you to systematically evaluate the impact of adding variables to the model and helps inform decisions about model complexity based on statistical significance.
If your data naturally lends itself to a nested model search, especially when you’re interested in a specific variable, then employing this approach is quite reasonable. The nested model search is particularly suitable when you want to analyze a series of models that gradually become more complex while including the terms from the previous models. However, this technique has limitations, it works best when the models you’re examining are nested. If the models are not nested, more advanced methods like information criteria may be necessary, but those are topics for a prediction-focused class.</p>
<p>In this section, you’ve learned a couple of model selection techniques and the basic consequences of including or excluding variables in your models. These consequences affect the coefficients and residual variance estimates, and while we haven’t delved into other model assumptions like linearity and normality, it’s crucial to approach your model with a degree of skepticism, acknowledging that it’s likely to be imperfect. The famous quote by George Box, “All models are wrong, some models are useful,” serves as a guiding principle. Recognize that your model may not perfectly capture the complexity of reality, but if it provides valuable insights and proves useful in understanding your dataset, it serves its purpose. I hope this lecture has equipped you with valuable tools, and I look forward to our next session.</p>

<p>Your assignment is to study how income varies across different categories of college majors. You will be using data from a study of recent college graduates. Make sure to use good practices that you have learned so far in this course and previous courses in the specialization.In particular, it is good practice to specify an analysis plan early in the process to avoid the “p-hacking” behavior of trying many analyses to find one that has desired results. If you want to learn more about “p-hacking”, you can visit
<a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/p-hacking/" class="uri">https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/p-hacking/</a></p>
<p>Your assignment is to study how income varies across college major categories. Specifically answer: “Is there an association between college major category and income?”</p>
<p>To get started, start a new R/RStudio session with a clean workspace. To do this in R, you can use the <code>q()</code> function to quit, then reopen R. The easiest way to do this in RStudio is to quit RStudio entirely and reopen it. After you have started a new session, run the following commands. This will load a <code>data.frame</code> called college for you to work with.</p>
