## Welcome to Regression Models

I am happy that you've chosen to take Regression Models, part of the Johns Hopkins Data Science Specialization on Coursera! This course presents the fundamentals of regression modeling that you will need for the rest of the specialization and ultimately for your work in the field of data science.

We believe that the key word in Data Science is "science". Our course track is focused on providing you with three things: (1) an introduction to the key ideas behind working with data in a scientific way that will produce new and reproducible insight, (2) an introduction to the tools that will allow you to execute on a data analytic strategy, from raw data in a database to a completed report with interactive graphics, and (3) on giving you plenty of hands on practice so you can learn the techniques for yourself.

Regression Models represents a both fundamental and foundational component of the series, and it presents the single most practical data analysis toolset. Using only a bare minimum of mathematics, we will attempt to provide you with the fundamentals for the application and practice of regression.

We are excited about the opportunity to attempt to scale Data Science education. We intend for the courses to be self-contained, fast-paced, and interactive, and we intend to run them frequently to give people with busy schedules the opportunity to work on material at their own pace.

## Some Basics

A couple of first week housekeeping items. First, make sure that you've had [R Programming](https://www.coursera.org/learn/r-programming) , the [Data Scientist's Toolbox](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-scientists-tools), [Reproducible Research](https://www.coursera.org/learn/regression-models/supplement/uCPA0/welcome-to-regression-models) and [Statistical Inference](https://www.coursera.org/learn/statistical-inference) before taking this class. At a minimum you must know: very basic git, basic R and most of the Statistical Inference Coursera class. The small amount of knitr that you need for the project you can pick up quickly.

An important aspect of this class is to peruse the materials in the github repository. All of the most up to date material can be found [here](https://github.com/bcaffo/courses/tree/master/07_RegressionModels). You should clone this repository as your first step in this class and make sure to fetch updates periodically. (Please issue pull requests so that we may improve the materials!) It is one of the most essential components of the Specialization that you start to use Git frequently. We're practicing what we preach as well by using the tools in the series to create the series, especially git. Note my [GitHub repo](https://github.com/bcaffo/courses) will generally be more up to date than the Data Science Specialization Repo.

The lectures are in the index.Rmd lecture files. In [Developing Data Products](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-products), we cover how to create these sorts of slides. However, for the time being, you should be able to open them in R Studio and look at their contents. You will see all of the R code to recreate the lectures. Going through the R code is the best way to familiarize yourself with the lecture materials.

### YouTube
If you'd prefer to watch the videos on YouTube, you can find them [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpl-gQkQivXjqHAJd2t-J_One_fYE55tC) and [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpl-gQkQivXhdgUCdaUQcdb31CRe8Mm2y).

## Syllabus (xxx)

Course Title: Regression Models

Course Instructor(s):The primary instructor of this class is [Brian Caffo](https://sites.google.com/view/bcaffo/home/).
Brian is a professor at Johns Hopkins Biostatistics and co-directs the [SMART working group](https://www.smart-stats.org).

This class is co-taught by Roger Peng and Jeff Leek. In addition, Sean Kross and Nick Carchedi have been helping greatly.

### Course Description:

Linear models, as their name implies, relates an outcome to a set of predictors of interest using linear assumptions. Regression models, a subset of linear models, are the most important statistical analysis tool in a data scientist's toolkit. This course covers regression analysis, least squares and inference using regression models. Special cases of the regression model, ANOVA and ANCOVA will be covered as well. Analysis of residuals and variability will be investigated. The course will cover modern thinking on model selection and novel uses of regression models including scatterplot smoothing.

### Course Content

This class has three main components:

- Least squares and linear regression
- Multivariable regression
- Generalized linear models

- - 03_04 Olio

- Module 4, Logistic Regression and Poisson Regression
- - 04_01 Logistic Regression
- - 04_02Poisson Regression
- - 04_03 Hodgepodge


### Book: Regression Models for Data Science in R. 

A companion book is available [here](https://leanpub.com/regmods). The book is published via leanpub, and the suggested price is $14.99. You can get it for free or pay what you feel it is worth.

### Quizzes

There are four weekly quizzes. You must earn a grade of at least 80% to pass a quiz. You may attempt each quiz up to 3 times in 8 hours. The score from your most successful attempt will count toward your final grade.

### Course Project

The Course Project is an opportunity to demonstrate the skills you have learned during the course. It is graded through peer assessment. You must earn a grade of at least 80% to pass the peer assessment.

### Grading Policy

You must score at least 80% on all assignments (Quizzes & Project) to pass the course.

Your final grade will be calculated as follows:

Quiz 1 = 15%
Quiz 2 = 15%
Quiz 3 = 15%
Quiz 4 = 15%
Course Project = 40%


#### swirl Programming Assignment (optional)

In this course, you have the option to use the [swirl](https://swirlstats.com) R package to practice some of the concepts we cover in lectures.

While these lessons will give you valuable practice and you are encouraged to complete as many as possible, please note that they are completely optional and you can get full marks in the class without completing them.

### Differences of opinion

Keep in mind that currently data analysis is as much art as it is science - so we may have a difference of opinion - and that is ok! Please refrain from angry, sarcastic, or abusive comments on the message boards. Our goal is to create a supportive community that helps the learning of all students, from the most advanced to those who are just seeing this material for the first time.
